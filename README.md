# Object Relational Mapping

This an example of how to write code to access a database in an organized, meaningful, and readable manner. 
This is an Object Relational Mapping project similar to Java Hibernate.
We are managing an Oracle SQL database using the Java Database Management System.

## Other uses
I chose Java, but PHP, C++, Python, or any object supporting language can be utilized. 
This method can also be used with JSON, MySQL, SQLite, NoSQL, spreadsheets, and even custom database software (csv files, for example). 

## TODO/Inspiration
A future project could build upon this and construct a database schema dynamically; if the programer passes values in for a new table, objects could set the server in motion to build a new table without shell scripting. This is how most modern Frameworks are setup.
